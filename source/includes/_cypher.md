# Cypher

Cypher at its core is a secure Key/Value store. But what makes cypher useful is the ability to securely store or generate credentials to connect to your instances. Not only are these credentials encrypted but by using a cypher you don't have to burn in connection credentials between instances into your apps.

Cypher keys can be revoked, either through lease timeouts or manually. So even if somebody were to gain access to your keys you could revoke access to the keys and generate new ones for your applications.

## Cypher Authentication

The cypher api endpoints allow for authentication via an special headers or the standard *Authentication: bear access_token*. Instead of an access token, an execution lease token can be used to authenticate.
An execution lease will be issued by Morpheus for certain tasks, such as Ansible, which can then use the token to read cypher keys.

Cypher has the following headers and url parameters available for authentication:

Name | Type | Description
--------- | ----------- | -----------
X-Cypher-Token | HTTP Header | An access token or an execution lease token.
X-Vault-Token | HTTP Header | An access token or an execution lease token.
X-Morpheus-Lease | HTTP Header | An execution lease token.
leaseToken | URL Parameter | An execution lease token.

## Read a Cypher Key


```shell
curl "https://api.gomorpheus.com/api/cypher/v1/secret/foo" \
  -H "Authorization: BEARER access_token"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "auth": null,
  "data": {
    "foo":"bar",
    "briefing":"top secret info"
  },
  "lease_duration": 2764800000,
  "lease_id": "",
  "renewable": false,
  "cypher": {
    "itemKey": "secret/foo",
    "leaseTimeout": 2764800000,
    "expireDate": "2019-03-18T20:15:51Z",
    "dateCreated": "2019-02-14T20:15:51Z",
    "lastUpdated": "2019-02-14T20:15:51Z",
    "lastAccessed": "2019-02-14T20:15:51Z"
  }
}
```

This endpoint retrieves a specific cypher key.
The value of the key is decrypted and returned as `data`.
It may be a String or an object with many `{"key":"value"}` pairs.
The type depends on the cypher engine's capabilities and what type of data was written to the key.  For example the `secret/` engine allows either a string or an object, while the `password/` engine will always store and return a string.

The `leaseTimeout` and `ttl` parameters are only relevant if the cypher engine will be creating a key that does not exist. eg. `password/`

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.gomorpheus.com/api/cypher/v1/:key`

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
key | The full cypher key including the mount prefix.

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
leaseTimeout | | The lease duration in milliseconds.
ttl | 32 days | Time to Live. The lease duration in seconds, or a human readable format eg. '15m', 8h, '7d'. This can be used instead of leaseTimeout.

## Read a Cypher with Lease


```shell

  }
}
```

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.gomorpheus.com/api/cypher/v1/:key`

### HTTP Headers

See [Cypher Authentication](#cypher-authentication) for details on specifying a lease token.

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
key | | The cypher key including the mount prefix.

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
leaseTimeout | | The lease duration in milliseconds.
ttl | 32 days | Time to Live. The lease duration in seconds, or a human readable format eg. '15m', 8h, '7d'. This can be used instead of leaseTimeout.

## Write a Cypher

```shell
curl -XPOST "https://api.gomorpheus.com/api/cypher/v1/secret/mymsg" \
  -H "Authorization: BEARER access_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"msg":"hello world"}'
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like readding a cypher key:.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.gomorpheus.com/api/cypher/v1`

### JSON Parameters

The following parameters are available under the root context of the JSON body.

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
ttl      | 32 days | Time to Live in seconds, or a human readable format eg. '15m', 8h, '7d'

The `secret/` engine stores the JSON payload itself as the value of the key.
The `ttl` payload key is a special key, that is present, will be parsed as the `ttl` parameter (lease duration in seconds).

#### Item Key

The *itemKey* contains two parts: the *mount* and the *key*, separated by a */*.

##### Available Mountpoints

Keys can have different behaviors depending on the specified mountpoint.

Mount | Description | Example
--------- | ------- | ---------
password | Generates a secure password of specified character length in the key pattern (or 15) with symbols, numbers, upper case, and lower case letters (i.e. password/15/mypass generates a 15 character password). | password/15/mypass
tfvars | This is a module to store a tfvars file for terraform. | tfvars/mytfvar
secret | This is the standard secret module that stores a key/value in encrypted form. | secret/mysecret
uuid | Returns a new UUID by key name when requested and stores the generated UUID by key name for a given lease timeout period. | uuid/autoMac1
key | Generates a Base 64 encoded AES Key of specified bit length in the key pattern (i.e. key/128/mykey generates a 128-bit key) | key/128/mykey

#### Lease Time

Quick MS Time Reference:

Time | MS
--------- | -------
Day      | 86400000
Week      | 604800000
Month (30 days)      |  2592000000
